		<p>Flowers are the reproductive parts of flowering plants, also known as angiosperms. They help in producing seeds through pollination and fertilization, often attracting pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds with their bright colors and pleasant fragrances. Beyond reproduction, flowers play a vital role in maintaining ecosystems and supporting food chains. For humans, they hold great importance in decoration, medicine, and cultural traditions. Thus, flowers are both biologically essential and culturally significant.</p>
